            <p>Hello, my name is Emir Velazquez and I am an aspiring Developer.
            My goal is to join a company that needs excellent individuals to depend on.
            I became interested in development because I've always had a passion for building things.
            When I was younger I used to build all sorts of toys and also got involved with a lot of art.
            One of the main art mediums I enjoyed working with was Sculpture.
            Another thing I really love is technology, especially computers and video games.</p>

            <p>After working full time and trying to still further my higher education, I decided to take both of my loves for art sculpting and technology.
            No better place to do that then by learning how to write code. 
            It is basically like making a sculpture using programming languages and I find it very challenging and rewarding.
            I am excited to be able to join a develpment team soon and continue to expand my knowledge. 
            Thank you for taking the time to read my introduction.</p>
